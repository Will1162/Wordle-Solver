# Wordle Solver

## About the project

Returns all the possible solutions to a Wordle game, provided what has already been played. This was primarily practice for the start of my Software Development university module, which used Java extensively. 

I made this program near the height of Wordle's peak as I was curious if it was possible to write a program to tell me all possible options the answer could be at the current state of any game.
